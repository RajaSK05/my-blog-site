The function handles finding the parent File node along with creating the slug. Run the development server again and you should see logged to the terminal two slugs, one for each markdown file.

Now you can add your new slugs directly onto the MarkdownRemark nodes. This is powerful, as any data you add to nodes is available to query later with GraphQL. So, it’ll be easy to get the slug when it comes time to create the pages.

To do so, you’ll use a function passed to your API implementation called createNodeField. This function allows you to create additional fields on nodes created by other plugins. Only the original creator of a node can directly modify the node—all other plugins (including your gatsby-node.js) must use this function to create additional fields.
